    <p style="color: rgb(19, 151, 222);">The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L; 487.8 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.[13] The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less power.[14][15]
        Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system.[16][17][18] The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.[19]   The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.[20]The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as Bugatti concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving.[2][21] Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its limited top speed.[22] Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg‑imp; 10.45 mpg‑US).[23]</p>

    <H3 align="left" style="color: rgb(19, 151, 222);">Sales:</H3><hr><br>
    <p style="color: rgb(244, 43, 8);">The first 200 cars were sold before the first was delivered.[24] The base price is €2,400,000 (2,550,000 US$)[25][24] and buyers were required to place a €200,000 (210,000 US$) deposit before their purchase.[24] The first three Chiron were delivered to their owners in Europe and the Middle East in March 2017.[26] In January 2022, every Chiron had been sold. In September 2023, Bugatti built the last base-spec (non-variant) Chiron; a Nocturne Black and Copper Chiron with a "Copper" tan interior.[27] The Chiron production run ended in May 2024 with the Chiron L'Ultime. A North-American market Super Sport model with fading blue paint and writings of the Chiron's history and achievements all over the car.[28] However, Bugatti still continues to manufacture cars based off the Chiron.[29]</p>
