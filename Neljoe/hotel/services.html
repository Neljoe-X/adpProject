        <img src="rooms.jpg" width="300" height="300"><br>Room service or in-room dining is a hotel service enabling guests to choose items of food and drink for delivery to their hotel room for consumption. Room service is organized as a subdivision within the food and beverage department of high-end hotel and resort properties. It is uncommon for room service to be offered in hotels that are not high-end, or in motels. Room service may also be provided for guests on cruise ships.[1] Room service may be provided on a 24-hour basis or limited to late night hours only. Due to the cost of customized orders and delivery of room service, prices charged to the patron are typically much higher than in the hotel's restaurant or tuck shop, and a gratuity is expected in some regions.</p><br>

        <li><h1 style="color: rgb(15, 236, 15);">Swimming Pool:</h1></li><br><img src="swim.jpg"><p>Hotel swimming pools remain one of the key attractions for all types of resorts. In fact, they are among the main trends in the hospitality sector, and continue to be a must-have for some customers in both urban hotels and resorts. The photo opportunities and the fun activities typically associated with hotel swimming pools (relaxation, fun, sports) are two of the main motivations attracting clients today.

            The addition of surrounding elements (from cocktail bars to water shows or water parks) help build a unique leisure space that pushes these businesses’ economic performance further. Choosing the right aquatic installation is most important to ensure end-users are satisfied and pool operators’ investments are efficient.</p>
        <li><h1 style="color: rgb(15, 236, 15);">AC rooms availble:</h1></li><br><img src="ac.jpg"><br><p>Air conditioning works by removing hot air from inside a room and releasing cooler air to lower the temperature. The process follows the same principle used in standard refrigerators, where heat is absorbed and removed to keep the chamber cool or within the user’s preferred temperature range. The entire process can be broken down into the following five steps: 

            Warm air in the guest rooms is drawn by the air conditioner. 
            The air is moved via a cold evaporator inside the air conditioner, which cools it down. At this point, a dehumidifier also removes excess moisture from the air. 
            A coolant running through chill pipes absorbs the heat from the air and evaporates. 
            As the warm air loses heat and cools down, it is pushed from the chill pipes ready to be recirculated back to the rooms. The coolant is condensed back into a liquid by a compressor. 
            The cool or cold air is pumped back into the rooms, where it helps to push down the ambient temperatures. </p>
