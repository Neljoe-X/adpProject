    <h2><u>ARCHITECTURE</u></h2>
    <H3>The Taj Mahal, a breathtaking mausoleum in Agra, India, is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture.
         Its symmetrical design, intricate carvings, and white marble facade are a testament to the skilled 
         craftsmanship of its time. The monument's central dome, flanked by four smaller domes and minarets, 
         is a striking example of the fusion of Persian, Indian, and Turkish architectural styles. 
         The surrounding Charbagh garden, a Persian-style paradise with four quadrants, further enhances 
         the monument's beauty and serenity.</H3>
