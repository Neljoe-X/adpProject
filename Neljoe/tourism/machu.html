    <h2><u>ARCHITECTURE</u></h2>
    <H3>Machu Picchu, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a testament to the Incas'
    architectural prowess. The ancient city is nestled high in the Andes Mountains
    of Peru, its intricate stonework blending seamlessly with the rugged landscape.
    The Incas employed a unique technique known as "dry stone masonry," where large,
    precisely cut stones were fitted together without mortar. This method not only 
    ensured structural stability but also allowed the buildings to withstand 
    earthquakes and other natural disasters. The city's layout was carefully planned, 
    with terraced fields, irrigation systems, and a network of pathways connecting 
    various structures. The most iconic feature of Machu Picchu is the Temple of 
    the Sun, a circular structure with a large stone monolith at its center. The city's 
    architecture reflects the Incas' deep understanding of astronomy, as evidenced 
    by the alignment of buildings with celestial bodies.</H3>
    <h2><U>T0URISM</U></h2>
    <h3>Machu Picchu, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a popular tourist destination in Peru.
    The ancient Inca city is renowned for its breathtaking architecture and stunning 
    natural beauty. To visit Machu Picchu, you'll typically need to fly to Cusco, 
    the nearest major city. From there, you can take a scenic train journey to 
    Aguas Calientes, the town closest to the ruins. Alternatively, for a more 
    adventurous experience, you can hike the famous Inca Trail. Once at Machu Picchu, 
    you can explore the ruins, visit the iconic Temple of the Sun, and hike Huayna Picchu 
    or Machu Picchu Mountain for panoramic views. Guided tours are also available to help 
    you learn more about the history and significance of the site. It's important to note 
    that Machu Picchu can get crowded, especially during peak season (June to August). 
    If you're looking for a less hectic experience, consider visiting during the shoulder 
    seasons (April, May, September, October) or the rainy season (December to March).
